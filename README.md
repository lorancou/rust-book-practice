# Code practice for the Rust book

This is a repository of the code practice bits in *The Rust Programming Language*: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/. Each directory corresponds to a chapter of the book, with a Cargo package where applicable.

Everything should compile and run, without warning:
  - Code samples that are not functional are commented out.
  - Unused variables are prefixed with an underscore.

For code samples from the "core" text, functions and structs declarations are often inlined straight in the main() function body to follow the book reading flow. This might feel a little awkward, but the idea is to prevent mixing up concepts to much. Coding exercises ("ex") are written using a more "traditional" fashion.
